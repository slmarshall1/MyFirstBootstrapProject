      <p>I wish I had been able to use the fabric.js library for my first assignment.  It is so much easier than using the native canvas API.</p>

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>My tutor was correct with her information about web development.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel and code every website from scratch.  We can utilize frameworks like bootstrap and learn to customize them.</p>

      <h3>Bootstrap Framework</h3> 
      <p>I usually don't enjoy coding, however, using the Bootstrap framework and the fabric.js library I have enjoyed creating this assignment.</p>

  <h2>Using Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
  <p>I am trying to incorporate the Fabric.js library into my first Bootstrap page. I have created a small canvas size.   I have today 25 January managed to call the canvas and display the hello world using fabric.js.  After researching further fabric.js I have created a series of shapes that load in the shape of a house and sun.  My next step is to animate the sunrise.</p>
